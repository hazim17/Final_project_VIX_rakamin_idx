The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. A credit score is based on credit history: number of open accounts, total levels of debt, repayment history, and other factors. Lenders use credit scores to evaluate the probability that an individual will repay loans in a timely manner.\n","\n","A credit score can significantly affect the customer that uses it. It plays a key role in a lender's decision to offer you credit. People with credit scores lower, for example, are generally considered to be subprime borrowers. Lending institutions often charge interest on subprime mortgages at a rate higher than a conventional mortgage in order to compensate themselves for carrying more risk. \n","\n","=> Objective: \n","For this project, we won't calculate the credit score, rather we want to classify the customer that is 'good' or 'bad' consumer creditworthiness. So, using the dataset given dataset, IDX partners want Us to create a model to predict loan credit risk. Then, we need to create a visual presentation to present the result to the client.\n","\n","\n","=> Refrences: \n","- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club?datasetId=902&sortBy=voteCount\n","- https://www.kaggle.com/code/faressayah/lending-club-loan-defaulters-prediction"],"metadata":{"id":"3jROCsWktnSZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Variable description\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ERkbDG22uNFo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# import libraries\n","\n","import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd \n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# set the max columns to none\n","pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)"],"metadata":{"id":"LHR3xZ-nyH5S"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# read the csv file\n","link1 = '/content/drive/MyDrive/0.Data_analyst_important_thing/1.VIX_rakamin_DS_IDX/Tugas2_VIX_Rakamin_DS_IDX/file/loan_data_2007_2014.csv'\n","df = pd.read_csv(link1)\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":775},"id":"kEuzVvNizJWu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1654052451465,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":16007,"user":{"displayName":"M.
